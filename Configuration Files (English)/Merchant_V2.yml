#Note: After the player is offline, 
#      if there is a data operation that cannot be processed when the player is offline, 
#      it will be recorded in the player's profile and wait for processing.
#Example: The transaction is complete, but the player is offline,

#Whether to enable reading player head textures from GUIs to save to database
#Every time the server is restarted, all player head texture data needs to be re-fetched from the official server.
#Since most of the GUI of this plugin contains head itembuttons, 
#the plugin will automatically cache head texture data to reduce network load.
#This option can match whether the name of the head owner is the same as the target player's name
#from the GUI opened by the player, and use the cached data flexibly.
#If the target player's head is not saved in the database, the loaded head data will be stored in the database.
