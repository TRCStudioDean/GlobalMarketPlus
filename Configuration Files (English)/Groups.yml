        #Explanation: This option is used to set restrictions on players having special attributes when using different currency units. 
        #If this option is not set, the default parameters will be based on the restrictions of the attributes in the other settings above.
        #If the relevant options are set, their properties will be independent of the limitations of default attributes, for example:
        #- Limit: 10 selling items + Vault unit's 4 selling items = Actually a total of 14 items for sale can be upload to market.
        #- Tax: no tax rate is set, but 1% tax rate in Vault unit -> Only Vault unit has tax rate, while other units will be exempt from taxes
